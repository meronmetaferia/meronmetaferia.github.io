# Movies and TV Shows Analysis: Exploration of Four Major Streaming Platforms

There is a plethora of streaming services available for anyone with a credit card handy. For a person trying to choose a streaming platform, it can be an overly crowded space with so many choices. In this project, I will analyze a web scraped data that I found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/datasets) to compare the 4 big streaming platforms - Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Disney+. By the end of this analysis, I am sure you'll be able to choose which streaming service best suits your needs. Enjoy! ðŸ˜ƒ
